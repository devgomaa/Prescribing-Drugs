# Setting up the Environment
for doing this project, we need to set up the environment.

So first of all, you will need to install Python also install Jupiter Norge book on your system as we are going to work on this project using Jupiter notebook.

After applauding the data set in this folder, it is time to create a new notebook where we

will write the code for the project, open this stupid a notebook and change the name of this notebook

to prescribing drugs, using consumer reviews.

So in this project, we require some Python libraries which need to be installed and imported to install

these libraries. You just have to open your command prompt and type pip , install them library and we are all done.

We are going to use numpy for mathematical calculations, string for string manipulations, pandas for data frame manipulations, seabourne and matplotlib for data visualizations. 
And finally, we will import the ipywidgets Library for performing interactive analysis on the data.
