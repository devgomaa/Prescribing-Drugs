understand the reason behind the making of this dataset.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Let us suppose there is a pharmaceutical startup that was recently acquired by one of the world's largest Invensys.
For the acquisition process, the startup is required to tabulate all the drugs that they have sold and account for each drug's effectiveness.
And as you know that this data has been collected over the years and it contains data points such as the drug's name, reviews by customers, popularity and use, cases of the drug and so on.

Task 
----------------------------------------------------------------
 - provide a sophisticated and useful model using different NLP or machine learning techniques, using the dataset that has been provided.
 - Find out the most useful drugs for each condition and also try to find out some of the hidden trends and patterns that could help the company to make precise, data driven decisions.
